This project focuses on the development of probabilistic learning models in complex adaptive systems applied to risk management in cyber security.

It is supported by a CIFRE agreement (ANRT) and allows the financing of Lina El Houari's PhD over a period of three years since December 2020.

The partners are the company Risk'n TIC and the laboratories LMAH and LITIS/SFLog.

The deliverable consists of implementing statistical intrusion analysis models in information systems to provide recommendations to Risk'n TIC's clients. 

A first presentation of the context, the objectives and the mobilized methods will be made for the international conference ICoSCal'21, in Le Havre (November 2021).
