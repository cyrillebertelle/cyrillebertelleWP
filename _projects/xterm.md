The XTERM project (Complex Systems, Territorial Intelligence and Mobility) deals with the modelling of territorial systems and associated mobilities in the face of new societal and economic challenges. The territory is the support and the product of actors through a feedback loop that makes a system.

In this systemic approach, we consider that the multitude of individual behaviours (actors and/or agents), mobilities, intentions end up "making" the territory (at the scale of the city, the district, the region, etc.), without the final result necessarily corresponding to the choices, the representations or the intentions of certain actors. This approach therefore requires the integration of the organisational complexity existing within these systems. It also requires taking into account territorial and societal dynamics and developments.

**Key words**: complex networks, mobility, territorial competitiveness, morpho-dynamics, decision support systems.

**XTERM proposes to bring elements of answers, rich in a structuring already established during the previous CPER, within the RISC project and the XTERM prefiguration year (GRR 2014 campaign) and which brought together a large number of actors. We go beyond a project vision to pose general problems on territorial structuring. We approach them through innovative methodologies inspired by the concepts of complex systems. The Normandy region benefits from the Institute of Complex Systems in Normandy (ISCN), a well-identified node of the national network on complex systems, in strong interaction with XTERM. Finally, in July 2015, XTERM was awarded the label of the Nov@log competitiveness cluster for its ability to fuel technological research and innovation.**

**Scientific coordinators** : Patricia Sajous (IDEES, University of Le Havre Normandie) and Cyrille Bertelle (LITIS, University of Le Havre Normandie)

A consortium has been developed for this project. Since its launch, it has brought together 139 participants corresponding to 68 permanent staff, 35 external collaborators and 36 contractual staff (doctoral students, ATER, IGE or IGR) from 14 research organisations belonging to 8 institutions (Universities of Le Havre Normandie, Rouen Normandie and Caen Normandie, Insa of Rouen Normandie, IDIT, NEOMA- BS, CESI, ESIGELEC) : CETAPS (Rouen), CORIA (Rouen), CRITT TL (Le Havre), IDIT (Rouen), LITIS (Le Havre and Rouen), LMAH (Le Havre), LMI (Rouen), LMR (Rouen), LMRS (Rouen), MOBIS / NEOMA Business school (Rouen), IDEES-LTG (Rouen), IRSEEM / ESIGELEC (Rouen), IRISE / CISE

The overall grant obtained was 1.5 MEuros.

At the end of the project, this consortium produced a total of 151 articles in scientific journals, 179 conference papers and 34 other publications (books, coordination of special issues of journals, theses, etc.) on the subjects developed in this project. 

It also gave rise to the international symposium [XTerM2019](https://xterm2019.sciencesconf.org/) and the publication of a [collective book with Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-59302-5)

An activity report of 232 pages was produced at the end of the project and is available [here](https://cyrillebertelle.github.io/cyrillebertelleWP/assets/pdf/Rapport-Scientifique-xterM201911.pdf)

Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    ---
    layout: page
    title: project

    ---

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/3.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/5.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/5.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
```
