Summary of my research interests and activities

***
My research topics concern the modelling and the simulation of complex systems and networks applied to territorial and logistic systems.

The aim is to produce tools of analysis and numerical reconstruction of their complexity for the engineering of territorial intelligence. 

I developed these last years operations of valorization near the actors and the operators of Le Havre and Normandy territories to promote the concept of smart ports and the development of blockchain technologies.
