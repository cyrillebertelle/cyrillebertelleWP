### Management of laboratories, institutes, international networks, research teams

* **President of the GIS "Institute for intelligent logistics in the Seine Valley"**, since December 2020. The creation of this GIS follows a working group set up since 2017 by Prefect Philizot of the inter-ministerial mission of the Seine Valley, in order to structure and coordinate research in logistics in the Normandy and Ile de France regions.

* **Director of research at ISEL**, an internal engineering school of the University of Le Havre Normandie, from April 2018 to December 2019. A specific effort is required to strengthen the visibility of academic and partnership research activities to prepare for the renewal of the CTI label, which recommends the need for a link with the SFLog federative structure that I direct.

* **Coordinator of "Pôle CTM"**,one of the 5 strategic research and training clusters of the ComUE Normandie Université, the Land-Sea Continuum cluster, since March 2017. The purpose of this strategic cluster is to ensure the training-research-innovation continuum within a highly interdisciplinary scientific perimeter, anchored in an integrated approach to the Normandy territory and its specificities. Its mission is to manage the regional research support systems that Normandy offers, within the scope of its competences. It animates the ComUE by organising scientific days within its scope of influence, inviting all the academic and socio-professional players concerned in Normandy. He is responsible for monitoring and mobilising Normandy players in the context of the PIA calls for proposals in which he is competent to respond (success of the PIA3 TIGA 2017 "Smart Port City", led by the CODAH).

* **Director of the federative structure in Logistics EDF 4230 SFLog**, since May 2016. This federative structure currently brings together 10 research laboratories from 6 institutions: ULHN, EMN, ENSM, ESIGELEC, NEOMA BS, IDIT. I also manage the research part of the Pôle Ingénieur et Logistique (PIL) / Campus Logistique, which was inaugurated in October 2016 and consists of 4 technical platforms and halls.

* **Co-coordinator of the international UniTwin UNESCO network "CS-DC / Complex Systems Digital Campus"**, led by the universities of Le Havre and Strasbourg (Pierre Collet is the co-coordinator), since 2014, when it was set up and recognised by UNESCO. This network brings together more than 120 universities and higher education institutions (signatories of a partnership agreement) in some twenty countries.

* **Co-founder and co-director of the ISCN** (Institut des systèmes Complexes en Normandie) which, as the third node of the National Complex Systems Network (RNSC), has enjoyed national and international visibility since 2011. Amongst others, we note the organisation of CSSS2013, the 5th French international school on complex systems which was organised in Le Havre in July 2013, as well as the annual national meetings of the RNSC which were organised in Le Havre also in November 2015.

* **Co-leader of the "Complex systems" axis in the CNRS 3638 NormaSTIC federation**, which brings together Normandy university researchers in ICST, from 2014 to 2018.
